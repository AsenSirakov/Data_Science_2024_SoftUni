France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Great service and wine but inedible food,Mar 2023 •,"Sadly I  used the high TripAdvisor rating too literally. We have been fortunate to eat at a number of fine restaurants so  know that amazing buzz from  a mouthful of fine freshly cooked food from a great chef.
Never before have we eaten a tasting menu and never will we again.
Ad Hoc has a great ambience with attentive friendly service and all the paired wines were exceptional.
Maybe we hit a night when the chef was off but every single course of food was certainly not freshly cooked and , as we passed the kitchen on the way to the bathroom, noticed plates of  precooked food ready to go on the tasting menu plates. If it had been the odd dish that disappointed, we would have accepted that it might have just been our palates not liking it. As it was every plate of food was not hot, bland, lacking any spark and had probably been sitting around for a while.l
All the serving staff were great as was the wine but I failed to finish any plate offered. 
The tasting menu looked good value but a simple bowl of hot freshly cooked pasta would have done better justice to the wine.
When asked ,I admitted , with that great English understatement, that I had been disappointed. I found 17 euros had been deducted from the 190 euro bill so it was nice that they noticed.
Probably best to avoid the tasting menus and enjoy their great wine selection with some pasta and maybe cheese course.

I feel responsible that I made a poor choice not realizing that this is a place geared for tourists.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Avoid- Worst meal in Rome - possibly ever,Nov 2022 •,"From the start this meal was bad- especially given the price. We visited for my husbands birthday after being recommended by our local hotel. The lady in charge appeared at our table as we arrived to basically up-sell the truffle menu.

If the food had been good we could have forgiven this but it wasn’t. The best parts were the bland bits as at least they were inoffensive - nothing was seasoned and sauces were completely tasteless with strange and weird combinations.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Shocking management, TERRIBLE service by mum and daughter!! FOR Tourist ONLY!!",Jul 2021 •,"We visited this restaurant on Saturday night and we had the most disappointing service and food experience ever. It was my partner's bday celebration weekend. 

The restaurant is run by a blonde Manager and her daughter wich had the most terrible attitude, they both made sure we will never be back there.
We were sitting at the table near the window but the ac was off and outside about 35 degrees. Halfway through our meal (truffle tasting menu with wine pairing), we asked to move anywhere else because it was too warm there.
The young waitress (the daughter) asked the manager (her mum) to move us, but she replies a very sharp NO!!!!! Also, a dog pooped just in front of us, on the pedestrian side, but apparently, according to the same waitress, that was nothing that concerned the restaurant. Anyhow now not only was it crazy hot but with a nice poo view too.
So we could not move anywhere even though the restaurant was empty, for no reason. Asked to talk to her mum (The Manager) she never touches the table or acknowledges us. How can you deny to a couple with 230 euro bills to move to another table when your restaurant is empty? 
Finally, a gem of a waitress with curly hair approached the table and moved us to another spot, where we spent the rest of the evening in confinement because as I said one side of the restaurant was empty for the whole night.
I have been managing restaurants for my whole life, and I never gave such an awful service and attitude to my guests.

The tempo of service completely wrong, food was getting to our table way earlier than wine.
The wine was poured into the glasses and set in the station for about 20 minutes before being served, subjected to the bacterias and dust since everyone was passing by.

Rubbery, overcooked octopus, brittle fried pumpkin flowers, devoid of taste, topped with cold ricotta, a filet that could only be described as a low-end USDA Choice from a chain steakhouse in the US, also rubbery and tasteless.  At least the fish was cooked properly, but was lying on a hockey puck of warm wilted spinach.

Appallingly bad service, one hour to get the appetizer.  They seem to be totally confused about everything.    And 160 euros for the experience.  There is a traditional Italian restaurant about two doors up that was packed.  Ad Hoc wasn’t.  I can see why.",-0.9442,Negative,4

I'll start by saying that the hospitality and staff was amongst the best I received during my 10 stop Italian tour. The free glass of wine, the free pre desert and the free bottle of house olive oil was appreciated and the staff were excellent in every way especially the bald waiter with the blue eyes who was amazing at his job but the food was total crap!

We each got the black truffle tasting menu, it was our last night so we decided to splash out a bit and the table behind us (an American family) also got the black truffle tasting menu. The starters were ok. 2 of them were the same but one had basil and the beef tartar was bland.

The truffle carbonara was very nice, but the spaghetti dish was average. The ox cheek was tough with a sirloin type fat down one side. At this time the table behind us got a steak and we noticed them complaining that it was tough so it wasn't just us. For this reason I believe the meat to be poorly sourced. The duck however was decent.

The deserts were all crap, we actually didn't finish them. Meanwhile the Americans on the table behind us were blown away by the same dishes we disliked which leads me to believe that the reviews of this place are mostly by Americans ""visiting Europe"".

I'd rather say nothing because everybody can have an off night and I've worked in food and know how tough it can be. But one thing out of several missteps prompted me to write this. I hope I save someone who really wants to experience good Roman food from disappointment (and it's not hard to find good food in Rome!).  First, this is tourist food; upscale to be sure. The focus on truffles is not really representative of Roman cuisine (if that's what you what).  You can get that type of menu in many upscale hotels in many places. I could tolerate that--it is what it is-- had our food been served appropriately.I went for the Roman menu hoping for tradition and creativity to meet well. My partner went for the land menu.

The poor server was very apologetic and refused to let us pay. I'm hoping this was a problematic evening and won't occur again, although I'm pretty sure much of the food is made too far ahead (fried foods much be served subito-- the fritti were lukewarm going on cold) or the food isn't getting from kitchen to table promptly.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Far behind expectations - what did we miss?,Jun 2017 •,"After several recommendations, and a quick read through on TA feedbacks - we booked Ad Hoc for our last night in Rome. We are both global travelers, and we know a good restaurant from a great. This ended up as neither of the two.
We arrived with expectations, and our expectations were raised even further after being escorted to our table. The interior is inviting - with romantic seating and wine bottles covering the wall from floor to ceiling. Prosecco as a complimentary aperitif is never wrong either.
We received the menu, and decided to go with the truffle tasting menu - despite being slightly off season. We went with full wine pairing, and from here and out our expectations were thrown off a cliff...
The one thing that surprised us the most, was the constant waiting(which we could easily notice being a distraction for the tables next to us as well) There was an extreme amount of dead time between the courses, and this is where we found the wine pairing to be a mistake. The wines offered as part of the wine package were well balanced with the courses served, but in small servings. With 30 minutes to the next course, and with no offers for a refill or other supplementary drinks. Weird!
Food? Started off well with a variety of starters. Cheese, deep fried veggies and truffles as front runners - the starter was heavy...but rather pleasant. Last one on the plate was a beef tartare. Unseasoned, as they felt we should season by taste ourselves... What???
Pasta course was a duo of pastas. Both creamy and cheesy and heavy - loaded with truffle shavings. I'd loved it if this was the only heavy course, but already by now - the meal is loosing balance. There are no vegetables, and no acidity to balance the weight of cream/cheese/truffles.
Main course. Duck breast and beef cheek loaded with truffles. Duck breast - cold and rubbery. Beef cheek - cold and tasteless(salty if anything at all) We sent it back, and started to loose patience.
Decided to wait for desserts. All good, but guess what - all creamy and heavy! A fresh sorbet could have saved half the day, but was unfortunately not part of the game.
All in all - I can only recommend the wines served(although served in a strange way...bottles were never brought to the table?)
We had the main courses removed from our bill - which helped on our mood...although I took that more or less for granted.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Rip-off in Ripetta street: the most over-rated restaurant ever.,Jan 2017 •,"We (my wife, my son and I) had a terrible experience in ad-hoc on Thursday 5 January 2017. It is a miracle that this restaurant is in the Roma top 100 with such poor food, atmosphere, attitude, service, organisation, heating, etc...Only the wine was good. We had far far far better experiences during our stay in Roma, including at Babette, which is in the same area.
We booked by phone the day before for three and arrived on time at 800pm. We were seated in the room on the right side when you enter the restaurant and we felt immediatly uncomfortable with the temperature of the room despite a very visible (and working) heating system. There were permanent flows of cold and hot airs in the room. We complained to the head waitress (the boss?) who said they have a problem with the door (in fact, even when the door was completly closed, the issue with the temperature was more or less the same) and said she will do her best to move us to another table. This did not happen despite a table that we could see became available at some stage and stayed free for may be 30 minutes. At the end of the dinner (during which my wife kept her coat...) we asked why she did not move us to the other table and she said (believe it or not): ""because it is a table for four and you are only three""....translation: i do not care about your health but i care about making money even if i have to over-promise for this.
Generally speaking we found that the head waitress (the boss?) overpromised on everything during this dinner...and under-delivered.
Regarding food, the truffle experience was expensive and disappointing. We would rate the food somewhere between ""nothing special"" for the pasta and ""bad"" for the duck which was served dry when we asked medium rare. We noticed that people at the table next to us complained about the beef.
The Tuscany red wine was good...but do you need to introduce it with tons of words and superlatives as you would do for a Chateau Petrus 1982?
The service was very very long...it took one hour to get the first course and then another hour to get the second one and nothing seemed really properly organised and managed.
When we decided to stop the experience before the dessert and asked for the bill, the head waitress (the boss?) asked about our feeling. We told us exactly what was our view: big problem with the temperature, no transfer to the other table when it was available, nothing special (at best) with the food and good wine. She said several times she was confused but did not seem to be so confused...More a bad actress than a good head waitress (or a boss?).
The bill included a 10% discount which seems to be applicable when you make an internet booking...but we realized after we left the restaurant that our first courses were charged at €30 vs €25. Based on other reviews, we believe it is because the black trufle was partly replaced by white trufle. This was our choice but when this option was proposed by the waitress she never mentioned we have to pay an extra for this.
Finally, when we asked for our coats, a waitress gave us a probably very expensive Moncler down jacket...which was not belonging to us. Imagine what could have happened with clients less honest than we are...Don't go there with expensive coats!

It took 30 minutes to get our order taken. The server did apologize for the delay but the incredibly slow pace continued. 

45 minutes into our visit, we received bread. 1/2 of the bread was very dry and without much taste/flavour. 

On two occasions the server said our dinner would be coming right away but it never did. It took almost 3 hours before the main course was served. My husband ordered the Sea Tasting Menu and I had the Land Tasting Menu.  We both found the food to be excessively salty and very average overall.

Against our better judgement, we decided to order dessert. The tiramisu was too soupy/soggy and was probably the worst I have ever had.

The server never offered to refill our beverages and never asked if we were enjoying our meal. They ignored us for most of the evening. 

While the bathroom was clean there were no hand towels at all. 

It then took us a very long time to get the bill because the servers continued to avoid us.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Wish we had gone some place else for special occasion,Aug 2016 •,"I really wanted to like this place, we had our 10 year anniversary in Rome and after I found out my first choice was closed for the summer holidays, we decided this would be perfect. 
Now we were a party of 4, 2 ordered the Truffle tasting menu, one the land menu and the other they created a truffle tasting menu for vegetarians, all with matching wines... bill came to 420 odd Euros...so wasn't a cheap meal but nor was is great...

Firstly and perhaps those that don't order the truffles will get a better experience but I found the menu to be unimaginative and merely they just put slices of truffle on everything. It started with being presented with a small table spoon of cold mash potato, compliments of the chef they said...um ok wasn't particularly tasty I left half of mine. 
then came the tasting plate, this was perhaps the nicest of all the dishes, a plate segmented into 3 with a cold battered pumpkin flower, a burrata, and the poorest excuse of steak tartar I have ever seen. simply a square of raw mince and 3 slices of truffle, no capers, nothing else. 
the pasta was presented , two of them , however they tasted exactly the same...i liked them but wondered why you would put two of essentially the same pasta of the same plate... this was also an issue as the pasta was on this silly little plate and whilst eating one side the other got cold so again that wasn't very nice.
Next the mains...2 tiny slices of dry over cooked duck breast with sliced truffle, on what appeared to be the same cold potato we got at the start, and a beef cheek thing, which was nice, but some what confused in the whole tasting menu...

You did however get a very good amount of truffles...this I can't fault them of... I however would recommend that people don't do the tasting menu, rather order from the main menu and perhaps order an item or 2 with truffles..

Finally we had what will perhaps be the worst Tiramisu I have every ordered, it tasted like it was one layer of biscuit and then they got some of the whipped cream in a can and sprayed on top....not nice, maybe at the Cheese cake factory but not at a decent restaurant.

Now the final and somewhat laughable moment, some of our group wanted to buy fresh truffles, they went to the back and were presented with fresh black truffles ....how much we ask ...600 euro a kilo....umm no
Next morning we go to Campo Di Fiori ask the vendor who talks to a guy, price 180 euro a kilo.....

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Minority Report,Feb 2016 •,"For restaurants as highly regarded as Ad Hoc, the majority of Tripadvisor reviews gush with unbridled delight, while a tiny minority will tell you it's all hype and a waste of money. Sadly, this time I have to side with the naysayers. 

There were three of us. Two ordered tasting menus paired with wines; one ordered a la cart. The consensus: no interesting flavors in anything we tried, salt being the dominant (and only clearly discernible) one. We did not complain, but it felt like the staff knew the kitchen was underperforming; everyone around was plied with multiple freebies. We received complimentary sparkling wine with a pre-appetizer, a pre-desert and a post-desert, an extra desert wine and a take home bag of goodies. The restaurant is very cute, has a nice vibe, and an interesting sounding menu that offers creative alternatives to traditional Roman food. It has an impressive wine collection and accommodating staff. It could have been a wonderful place—if it served good food.

After clearing the table from the main courses we had to wait 15-20 minutes for a waitress to approach us. After loosing hope to get someone's attention, we gave up desert and ask for the bill.
The only positive element at this place was the wide selection of wines they offer, unfortunately, it doesn't come with  a sommelier to assist the dinners. 
Overall it was a a very disappointing experience and the high rating the place is an unexplainable mystery.",-0.9431,Negative,3

A well behaved toddler at an adjacent table eventually started to lose interest in remaining well behaved (as is reasonably expected) and that detracted as much from the fine dining experience as did the seating of male guests in shorts.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Beyond Disappointing!,Apr 2014 •,"I recently arrived about five minutes early for a 9:30pm dinner reservation on a Saturday evening.  I had planned on doing the tasting menu as it was the last evening of my holiday.  The reviews on Trip Advisor were relatively positive, so this helped to drive my dining decision for that evening.

Upon arrival at the restaurant, there was no host or hostess at the door to greet customers.  I understand that service is quite lacking in Italy and not up to American standards, but a simple greeting is not much to expect.  I observed two rather haggard looking servers who were running around like chickens with their heads cut off as the restaurant was pretty full.

My guest and I were finally greeted by one of the servers who was a bit snarly.  She sat us at our table, which faced both the front door and the service station, so it really wasn't the best seat in the house.  I was disappointed, but there really was not anything that we could do about it.

We were presented with menus after about a 5 minute wait and then our server disappeared to assist with other tables.  After about 15 minutes, she came over and took our order, including our wine order.  But then disappeared.  Each time that we tried to flag her down, she just rolled her eyes at us and ran to assist the other server or other tables.

After another 10 minutes, she came back and informed us that the wine that we had ordered was no longer available.  I then proceeded to select another wine.  She then returned to the table 10 minutes later with the new bottle.  The appalling part is that she simply slammed the bottle down on the table and then ran off to assist another table without opening our wine.  I'm really not sure why, but her behavior was unprofessional and downright insulting.  

So now after 40 minutes of sitting at the table, we still had no wine or food.  This was probably some of the sloppiest and rudest service that I have ever experienced. This is not the way that we envisioned our last meal in Rome.  My guest and I ultimately decided to leave and find a restaurant that appreciated our business.  As such, we simply got up and left.  The funny part is that neither server even noticed that we were leaving or had left as they were too busy with other tables. 

Hopefully, if you're seeking out a fine dining experience, which should include superior service in addition to good food, I would suggest looking elsewhere.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Left Unnoticed,Apr 2014 •,"We specifically went to this place after reading all the wonderful reviews here. It started out wonderfully with a truffle tasting in a private room with sparking wine. Unfortunately, what started out as an experience ended with us cutting off the meal early. 

We are a party of four and were the third table seated at our 6:30 reservation. We ordered a bottle of wine and appetizers. We had the pumpkin blossoms, the seafood sampler, and the cheese tasting. Everything was mediocre at best, but presented very nicely. Once the appetizer was cleared we finished our bottle of wine and had to wait 45 minutes before our pasta was brought to the table. Again this was mediocre at best, but displayed very nicely. 

The wait staff never came by to fill up water or ask we if wanted another bottle of wine. Finally they cleared the pasta and we set in to wait for our second course. A rabbit stuffed with spiced veal. Needless to say we never made it that far. At 9pm we had to get up and track the manager down, whom never once came over to check on us, and tell her we were done. 

The consolation was sending the head waitress over to offer a sparkling wine. For all the hype and the price you're paying, this was absolutely unacceptable and unenjoyable. We were very disappointed after all the high reviews here on trip advisor.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Would NOT recommend,Feb 2022 •,"My boyfriend and I visited the Ad Hoc restaurant on the second of our two night stay in Rome. We had read fantastic reviews and were really keen to go, we actually tired to book on our first evening to no avail, as it was fully booked. Having secured a table for our last night we were looking forward to a fantastic meal. We arrived and were greeted by a friendly-ish blonde lady (in a rather short skirt!) and were shown to our table. We were seated for at least 5 minutes, if not more, before anyone came over to offer us a menu/drink etc but were willing to overlook this because of the fantastic reputation. We finally had sight of a menu, not before being told that the prawns and cod were unavailable for the evening. We placed our order and thought all was well, until the waitress came over to confirm what my boyfriend had ordered because in her words she was 'confused': not something you expect when paying the prices they ask for. We were then served an apperetife by a different waitress and shown the wine list (finally!). The apperetife was lovely and we decided to order a bottle of Riesling wine to go with out food - not before having been told that they 'might not have it', due to a busy night the night before. Again, not what you would expect when paying through the nose for a gastronomic experience. After a long wait, our main courses finally arrived, although, sadly, all I could taste was an unhealthy level of salt over the main dish and the sides. We mentioned to the waitress after finishing our main courses that this was the case and she acknowledged this (having not checked our food and asked if we were ok the whole way through the meal). We were then left at our table for a fairly solid amount of time, during which we witnessed what was frankly a shocking display between two members of staff (curiously, both the staff members who had served us) engaging in a full blown argument which included raising voices in front of guests, slamming plates and menus and even resulted in the manager becoming involved. As an aside - the table next to us had ordered the taster menu and when their food arrived the waitress (the same one serving us) had to question the food she was serving them as she couldn't remember what it was and then proceeded to swap the plates round twice because she could not remember who had ordered what. We were then asked whether we would like a desert, to which we replied no and asked for the bill. We were then asked to come over to the window tables because the card machine would not work where we were sitting. Upon delivery of our bill, we were also issued with a feedback form, on which we commented that the food had been average and certainly not what you would expect for the price and the service had been terrible.

The decor of the restaurant was very nice, but I'm afraid that's as far as compliments for this place stretch. 

The waitresses were very immature and didn't seem to know anything about the menu. Either that or they just couldn't be bothered to explain anything to us. We placed our order and were not served our starter for 45 mins. It then took ANOTHER HOUR (I kid you not) to be served our mains. 

I ordered the smoked salmon pasta which was hard and actually inedible. I picked out the salmon and just sent it back without asking for a replacement, or refund before you ask. The whole dish was just a disaster. Quite frankly, my 7 year old can cook a better pasta dish than that which was served to me that evening. The pasta course alone was £15. 

The started, I can't remember what it was meant to be but it was heavy and greasy- possibly courgette flowers, I don't recall. 

I ordered the 2-spilt mains and chose the catch of the day and tuna. They were both terrible. Really, I might as well have been in Bella Italia in Croydon for the quality of the food. 

By the time we finished our first three courses it was nearly 11.30pm. By this point we were so tired and irritated by the poor service and poor food that we decided not to stay for dessert. Possibly the best decision I made during my weekend in Rome.

We were looking forward to our meal at Ad Hoc with great enthusiasm, and when I told my wife they had a Truffles tasting menu, her eyes glazed over.

They later moved us to another room that had only two other tables occupied at the time. Why they did not seat us there from the outset, I have no logical answer.
After looking over the menu, 
we ordered a bottle of red wine from Sicily. When I asked to have it decanted to help it breathe, the server said decanting was unnecessary,

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Not thrilled to be an outlier, but here is why we didn't like the restaurant",Mar 2013 •,"I am going to start this review by saying that I can not blame the restaurant completely.  We showed up  late for our already late reservation, and I think that the staff was not thrilled that we had shown up in the first place. But the situation quickly devolved from there.

My biggest negative  about the place may have been the mistranslations of the menu.  We were given English menus with Italian, which I can't argue against, but the translations were so bad that what we ordered and what we received were more than a little different.  For example, my older son ordered a beef filet.  What arrived was ground veal cheek with raisins and pine nuts. Which is what the Italian menu says it is.  They were nice about it and refunded our money,  but, for a place that clearly was full of British tourists, it seemed to be a major mistake.  An English menu item for suckling pig ended up being a rolled sausage of some form.  Since many of the reviewers had either a tasting menu or truffle pasta they may not have noted this but if you go ala carte its important. 

My wife had ordered the truffle pasta.  This was fine, but she originally received another pasta.  They did correct this error.  

Regardless of the menu descriptions, many of the dishes suffered from the ""one ingredient too many syndrome.""  

Other negatives may have been more temporary.  The restaurant was stuffy and hot.  Although our server was nice, the woman who appeared to be functioning as the head server was not.

For 20 mins we sat  and perused the menu. All good ,another 20 we sat and waited to be served . Finally an order is placed. We recieved our food. My ragu.. Well it was more stirfry. Beef strips than any ragu I have ever eaten.
The rest of the meal followed suit. Wine was slow to come out etc. I can tell you that for a 8 pm booking we had only recieved mains at 10.30 pm.  While our plates were cleared by 9.20. More than 1 hour to get our mains is little long. We  only ordered entree and mains thank god.
We witnessed the table next to us forgo the complimentary amuse bouche. Which was placed on her plate. Then picked up and offered by the waitstaff to the next table . We could not leave quick enough. 
I generally don't quibble with rankings but this is not a restaurant worthy of 1. 
If the food is executed well but not to my taste I have no issue. Thats my problem . Not the restaurant .

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,MAJOR Disappointment...Terrible Service....Average Food,May 2012 •,"I give the food 3 stars (average) and service 1 star (terrible)...for an overall rating of 2.
My fiance and I dined at Ad Hoc for our last meal of our 14 day Italian vacation. My 3rd trip to Rome. I did a lot of research and spent a lot of time choosing our restaurants for dinner. We were really looking forward to Ad Hoc on our last night in Rome. I now find it hard to believe all of the good reviews on trip advisor.  Before anyone books a reservation, I would urge you to read the less favorable reviews.  You will find 3 consistent themes:  Slow poor service, average food, high prices. 
Based upon the reviews, I expected the service to be extremely slow. It was beyond that...we and the other tables around us went through long periods of at least 30 minutes without ever seeing a waitress. 
A couple of quick notes:
1. The place is beautiful....very nicely decorated and comfortable elegant setting.
2. The food is very average.  I had the cacio e pepe, sea bass, and Italian cheese appetizer....none of the food was that good. My girlfriend had a pasta dish that was good...but not great considering all of the phenomenal food elsewhere on our trip.
3. The service is AWFUL.  We live in Los Angeles and I'm orginally from NY.  We are used to good and poor service in restaurants. I can even excuse poor service if the food is exceptional. That was not the case here. First, we were seated at the same time as 2 other tables with couples and provided menus.  I noticed the other tables were provided with wine lists but we were not. Waitress came by and asked if we wanted still or sparkling water...but no mention of wine.  I decided I would wait to see if she noticed.  30 minutes later she comes by to take our order....no mention of wine. 30 minutes later...appetizers come.  30 minutes later, appetizer plates are cleared. 45 minutes later main course arrives. At this point waitress asked ""Oh I'm sorry...do you want wine?""  I respectfully declined.  
An hour after serving us our main course, they finally clear the plates.  Another 1/2 hour goes by and nobody comes to our table to ask if we wanted dessert or coffee.  Finally, after more than 3 frustrating hours I politlely ask for the check.  After 15 minutes...no check!!!  So I finally get up and track down a waitress and ask again for the check. She responded very coldly...I'm trying to pay my bill!
To be clear....we noticed the same situation occuring with 2 other tables around us.  One couple sitting at the table directly in front of us where clearly unhappy and uncomfortable with the slow service.  They were constantly looking around for a waitress. My fiance noticed a guy dining alone sitting directly behind me.  She felt bad for him because he was seated and then left at the table without anything for 45 minutes before a waitress came to his table. 
This was an overall regrettable experience. This place could be a great restaurant...but with bad service and average food and outrageous prices....there are PLENTY of better options in Rome.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Terrible service,May 2012 •,"I reserved a table for 3 about a month before my trip to Rome because of the rave reviews on Tripadvisor. I am sorry to report back with an extremely negative review and I hope that I'm the only one who experienced this:

We arrived on time and was greeted by a lovely waitress and we told them who we were. It took them a rather long time to search for my reservation and seated us at the worst table possible in the entire restaurant - right beside a serving counter where all the dirty dishes were. We were looking at the back the entire night!! This became a major problem when we wanted to ask for the bill and in general got forgotten the whole night. 

1) We were in clear view of all the dirty dishes, the chaos, the drama and the waitress talk - all of which should be kept behind the scenes and not shown to us. 
2) The time difference between us finishing our course and the next course took more than 30 minutes. When we finished a course, the dishes were also cleared about 20-30 minutes later, so we spent most of the time looking at time, trying to get their attention, waiting for them to clear our dishes, while they zoomed in and out of their counter oblivious to our increasing impatience.
3) I honestly felt that they could have given us a better table since I reserved a month to 2 in advance?? 

The service and the waiting made the entire experience really miserable. It was such a nightmare trying to get their attention that we asked for the bill at the same time when we reminded them that we had a dessert that was not yet served. It is a pity that the lack of service has to ruin the chef's effort because the food there is pretty good but without the appropriate staff and amount of manpower, the restaurant just ruins the entire experience.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Our worst dining experience in Rome,May 2012 •,"Having had some really good food during our stay in Rome some meals costing only a few Euros, we decided to top off our last evening by visiting this restaurant which had good reviews on TA.
It was a memorable evening, unfortunately for all the wrong reasons.
We made a reservation an hour before, although they will have you believe the restaurant is so exclusive you must book a long way ahead. There were empty tables the night we went.
The specialism at this venue is a ""tasting menu"" accompanied by wine with each course at a cost of between 79 euros and 129 euros. We went for this as the individual menu was also very expensive.
Having been at the restaurant over an hour we had only just had our cold starter which although pretty to look at, tasted of nothing.
Almost an hour after that we were served a pasta course which for me was 3 different variations on pasta carbonara. Again nicely presented but almost cold. I would have sent it back but couldnt catch anyones eye. Therfore most of it was left and when the waitress came for the plates I told her I was disappointed in the dish. She said she was sorry I was disappointed.
We had been in the restaurant almost 2 and a half hours before the main course arrived by which time another party of 4 had left before finishing their courses. As only one of them spoke English or Italian they were at somewhat of a disavantage but were clearly unhappy and again there was a bland response to their concerns.
When our main course arrived I again said how disappointed I was with the experience thus far and that as it was now almost 10-30pm my appetite had waned. The lady serving said it wasnt her fault, they were at the mercy of the kitchen and chef so I offered to spaek personally to the chef, manager, owner, whoever was available. My offer was not taken up but several minutes later I was approached by another member of waiting staff who had come to tell me that my choice of desert was no longer available and would I like strudel. I declined and repeated my disappointment with the restaurant overall. She said she was sorry but the problem clearly lay with me as another customer had that evening had the same menu as I and he had enjoyed it and perhaps I lacked appreciation that all the food was freshly cooked. My response was that I could have cooked fresh carbonara in a lot less time than almost 1.5 hours plus and also produced it hot enough to eat.
She seemed keen to engage me in an arguement which I declined and we left soon after having spent 3 hours and over 200 euros for a mediocre meal in a very pretentious atmosphere which showed you dont always get what you pay for. They deducted 19 euros from the bill in consideration of the desert being unavailable.
On the plus side, the wine courses were good, not great but good and my husband said his beef was of the best quality.
In summary if pretentious snobbishness with astronomical prices appeals more than good honest food then this is the place to go but there are far better places in Rome with better food and service at a fraction of these prices.",really good food stay rome meal costing euro decided top last evening visiting restaurant good review ta memorable evening unfortunately wrong reason made reservation hour although believe restaurant exclusive must book long way ahead empty table night went specialism venue tasting menu accompanied wine course cost euro euro went individual menu also expensive restaurant hour cold starter although pretty look tasted nothing almost hour served pasta course different variation pasta carbonara nicely presented almost cold would sent back couldnt catch anyones eye therfore left waitress came plate told disappointed dish said sorry disappointed restaurant almost half hour main course arrived time another party left finishing course one spoke english italian somewhat disavantage clearly unhappy bland response concern main course arrived said disappointed experience thus far almost appetite waned lady serving said wasnt fault mercy kitchen chef offered spaek personally chef manager owner whoever available offer taken several minute later approached another member waiting staff come tell choice desert longer available would like strudel declined repeated disappointment restaurant overall said sorry problem clearly lay another customer evening menu enjoyed perhaps lacked appreciation food freshly cooked response could cooked fresh carbonara lot le time almost hour plus also produced hot enough eat seemed keen engage arguement declined left soon spent hour euro mediocre meal pretentious atmosphere showed dont always get pay deducted euro bill consideration desert unavailable plus side wine course good great good husband said beef best quality summary pretentious snobbishness astronomical price appeal good honest food place go far better place rome better food service fraction price,0.16666666666666666,0,1,"Our worst dining experience in Rome Having had some really good food during our stay in Rome some meals costing only a few Euros, we decided to top off our last evening by visiting this restaurant which had good reviews on TA.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,Overrated Tourist Trap,Mar 2012 •,"Living in Rome for almost five years, we have explored the Roman food scene and have truly found some gems. Over the years though, we have become somewhat complacent with our bubble of comfortable restaurants that we have discovered.

Now about to move from Rome, I got curious and checked trip advisor to see what others had thought of our beloved restaurants. Surprisingly, most of the highest rated restaurants I had never been to. Seeing this, I got ever more curious: perhaps we had missed out on a whole series of incredible restaurants in Rome? We decided to find out.

Ad Hoc was our first challenge to our previous favorites in Rome. Me, my mother, and girlfriend were excited. Rated so highly on trip advisor, I was truly expecting something above and beyond the rest.

The evening started well. We walked in without reservations and were seated promptly directly next to the hostess’s desk where they make reservations. The waitress kindly welcomed us, and everything seemed to be going well. The décor was also deliberate, and designed, unlike most of the humble family restaurants in Rome, where you are likely to see the walls decorated with a mosaic of football memorabilia from Forza Roma and photos of Italian movie actors and actresses from the 50s. This was refreshing for Rome, despite the fact that it definitely felt a little forced. 

The only disconcerting thing (so far) was the fact that there wasn’t an Italian customer in sight. A few English speaking customers surrounded us, and a German family was within sight in the other room.

After being seated, we were all served complimentary prossecco. The bread was notably good also. Not a bad start at all. The menu looked exciting as well. It is uncommon in Rome to find a chef willing to experiment. The menu contained twists on local Roman classics, as well as a list of dishes with truffles used as their main flavor and inspiration. I ordered the “Ad Hoc” gnocchi, my mother ordered the cacio e peppe, and my girlfriend ordered the carbonara three ways. We also tried a few appetizers: Roman style artichokes, fried pumpkin flowers, and some fried cheese wrap.

That is where the romance ended. First, one wine we ordered tasted as if it were watered down. I don't know any other way to describe it. We are not exactly wine snobs, but this wine was genuinely awful. We ordered a different wine and it was better, but still bad. The third was decent.

The appetizers, all fried, seemed as if they had been fried earlier and reheated somehow later. One of the fried cheese balls was actually room temperature. 
The food, both appetizers and main courses, were lacking flavor. The textures were off. Everything was slightly warm, but verging on room temperature. Felt reheated. 

The carbonara was very very sad, some of the worst we have ever had. Strange bland gnocchi. Soggy fried appetizers, caricatures of Roman classics.  The best was the caccio e pepe, which was below average. Everything was lacking punch. Depressing attempts at experimental. 

To be blunt, the food was awful. Far below average for Rome, at above average prices.

They also had a bizarre ritual of checking the reservation book before letting people in, even though they obviously knew that there were plenty of open seats. A depressing performance art. 

On the good side, the service was very attentive. Very helpful. No problems with the wait as other reviewers had described.. 

When we left, we were given a free bottle of prosecco. I am not sure if this because they thought we didn't enjoy our experience, but it was appreciated. 

Overall, this place is a tourist trap.

As soon as we walk in we were greeted by a sloppy and tacky shelf of magazines and books that hadn't been organized, dusted or paid any attention to it seemed in ages.  Ignoring this eye sore, we were seated in a tiny room with tables that were so close together that you could hear everything everyone was saying or doing and couldnt sit or eat comfortably. It was also filled with tired tourists, making the restaunt feel less genuine and more phony than one would want. Also, the room was lined with hundreds of dusty wine bottles that were very inconvienently placed at elbow level. So everytime you took a bite to eat you worried you were going to break an assumingly expensive bottle of wine. Also, to fetch a bottle of wine a waitress would have to interupt your dinner to manouevre it off the shelf. Because everything was so cluttered and cramped you felt you had to whisper and watch what you said during dinner so that the entire restaurant wouldn't hear your conversation. Not ok. So trying to ignore the tacky and cramped interior we had only high hopes for the food. The plates came out and  were very lovely, giving any reasonable person an expectaion of a delicious and gourmet meal. Every course was un utter disappointment.

We were left standing at the door for 5 minutes before being seated. We decided on the tasting menu for Land with wine. Although given a glass of prosecco when we were shown to our table, it took 35 minutes before we were served any food. 
Asparagus Roulade was overcooked.
Ravioli with Rabbit Ragout was very salty.
Ad Hoc Gnocchi were hard in the corners and I could have made a better sugo.
Saltimbocca alla Romana tasted like reconstituted meat in a roll.
Tiramisu was waterery and tasteless.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Negative,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-priced",Dec 2011 •,"Visited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening. It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged.

We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).

We were promptly seated, but then the trouble started.  It took nearly an hour for our order to be taken.

Returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes, they had room for us. Plenty of empty tables that evening actually (Sunday Nov. 7). Since we had been really overeating the whole trip, and I hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant, we decided to just go for the ""secondi piatti"" and skip the antipasti. Well, good for us that we did. We did get the complementary sparkling white whine, and then went for the lobster on my part, and four try-out meat-courses for hubby.  I agree with others, the servings were really small, and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway. Plates were cold, sucking the warmth out of the food. My lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold, dry rice. Lobster was ok, as the strings of honey-glazed lemons. As a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese; the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew, and the parmeggiano? Well, I am no expert, but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano. Dry and tasteless! My husband's glass of wine was more like one fourth glass, and measured digitally, mind you!

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Buzzing friendly joint,Jan 2017 •,"At the end of a long and freezing work day in France, this lively and warm restaurant/bar was a welcome and relaxing find.  

The bouncy waitress who greeted me at the door, Rochelle, spoke excellent English despite her French-looking name, so I didn't have to struggle with my poor French. Bonus #1 :)  

The place was packed and the only single seat Rochelle could find for me was in an obscure corner, kinda close to the toilets I think.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,"British-Style Pub in the Pretty Bércy Quartier. Micro-Brewery, too!",Jun 2014 •,"Best of The Frog chain of British-style pubs in France (also in one of the prettiest parts of France, Bércy).

The Frog at Bércy Village is located very close to Bércy underground station (about a 1 minute walk). Bércy Village, actually, is a short secluded lane with restaurants and shops on either side, not really a village after all. Bércy is the actual quartier. Close by is one of the many wonderful France attractions, La Cinémathéque Francaise (see my review). One more reason to go there.

The Frog Bércy is the prettiest of a chain of 4 British-style Pubs in central France, it's also a microbrewery. Their ales are British style (IPA, best bitter, stout - plus a Hoegaarden like lemony ale), and of very good quality. Admittedly, the prices for these beers are € 5 and up, so effectively even more expensive than in London. But then, France is the rip-off to end all other rip-offs, and beer prices can go up to € 10 for 500ml (not even a pint!). € 5 per glass are called ""happy hour"" around here! It's not even a tourist rip-off, because the French are always happy to rip off their own countrymen, too, in one fell swoop.

I had a couple of fine real ales there and fish and chips (what else!). The portion wasn't huge, but to compensate for that, it was small. The fish was of excellent quality, crisp, with a good bite and firm texture - the chips were a bit flabby, just like the ones you get at many British pubs. Home, sweet [spiritual] home. ;)

The decor is very pleasant indeed, and emphasizes the ""dual"" British-French nature of the pub. Despite the slightly inflated prices, the pub is extremely busy at lunch *and* dinner times. Well, it's a nice neighborhood after all.

France,The Frog at Bercy Village,Positive,Kicks Wetherspoons into touch!,Mar 2013 •,"This is not your typical little French Bistro or Patisserie. It's more like the French version of Wetherspoons but with far better food and service. We are a family of two adults and two children and were accommodated straight away on a busy Saturday night in France. There is a lively and bustling ( but non intimidatory) atmosphere at The Frog and the service was completely excellent. The waiters and waitresses are extremely busy but always have time for you and are always smiling and polite. One dark haired waitress had the type of smile that super models would die for! We didn't have to wait long for food. We had 2 x nachos for starters - excellent, good to see them being served with jalapeños as well- and 4 x various burgers ( inc. veggie ) for main meals. Again, could not fault these either. Basically, had a very good night at The Frog.

Beers, excellent and there was a really good choice.

Don't expect Bistro type drinks or food as this, as mentioned earlier, is a French type of Wetherspoons. The main difference though is excellent waiters, better beers, better food , better clientele and a superior atmosphere. No rowdiness, bad language or obese underdressed hen party- goers.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,This place lacks human decency,Sept 2011 •,"My husband and I are in Rome for our honeymoon and read up on Ad Hoc thinking it would be a nice treat. I made the reservations online and was accepted instantly. We showed up last night at 8pm all dressed up for our reservation when the woman kept going to the back of the restaurant looking it up again while seating other people. The restaurant at this point was empty and stayed that way at least to 8:15pm. It turns out in human error on my part after visiting 3 cities in 10 days I made the reservation for tonight at 8pm instead of last night. They refused to seat us! I ask nicely telling them we are on our honeymoon and all they said was 'so sorry' and escorted us to the door as if we were trying to break in. There was no manager (that I was aware of in sight) as I can't imagine they'd let this behavoir take place. I would also like to add that it was about 85 degrees last night and this place has NO AIR CONDITIONING. A part of us were relieved to not have to eat in that smoltering heat.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,Stay clear of this place!,Feb 2022 •,"After a 10 day vacation in Italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening (allthough I must admit our holiday was full of special meals...). Having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior, and I liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue, so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us. Returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes, they had room for us. Plenty of empty tables that evening actually (Sunday Nov. 7). Since we had been really overeating the whole trip, and I hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant, we decided to just go for the ""secondi piatti"" and skip the antipasti. Well, good for us that we did. We did get the complementary sparkling white whine, and then went for the lobster on my part, and four try-out meat-courses for hubby.  I agree with others, the servings were really small, and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway. Plates were cold, sucking the warmth out of the food. My lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold, dry rice. Lobster was ok, as the strings of honey-glazed lemons. As a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese; the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew, and the parmeggiano? Well, I am no expert, but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano. Dry and tasteless! My husband's glass of wine was more like one fourth glass, and measured digitally, mind you! We wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it, and really didn´t touch it, but lo and behold: they charged us for the bread!!! Not even in the cheapest joint! But here, oh yes, and 3 € it was! By the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the ever-sweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh! Thank God for speaking an unusual language (Swedish) and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot.  The whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man (the owner?) kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Negative,"Very slow, average food, lack of wine, totally over-priced",Dec 2011 •,"Visited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening. It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged.

It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,Highly recommend this fantastic restaurant,Jul 2019 •,"I booked Ad Hoc after reading some positive reviews and some reviews referring to birthday meals. We were in Rome for a wedding but it coincided with my girlfriend's birthday so I was on the look out for a good restaurant for that night. Booking from the UK was easy and the communication was good, I was e-mailed asking if I want to pre-order a dessert as I had mentioned it was for my girlfriend's birthday. The day before the booking I received a call to confirm and when we arrived we were warmly welcomed and taken to our seat, which seemed to be the best table in the restaurant in my opinion, and we had a complimentary glass of sparkling wine each. Our host and all the waitresses were absolutely brilliant, so attentive and really knew the menu inside out. When each dish was brought out we were given detailed descriptions. We were given a complimentary starter which was delicious and we all ordered something different, so the sommelier helped us pair a good wine to the dishes. All the courses were incredible, for me the Pasta with truffles was brilliant, this was a starter on the night, and the Suckling pig was so nice. At the end of the meal the lights went out and the waitresses sang happy birthday to my girlfriend and brought out the tiramisu that I pre-ordered. After the dessert we got yet another complimentary dessert selection of home made biscuits and then just before we left a bottle of Ad Hoc's olive oil, which we had during our starter and loved, so this was a lovely touch.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!,Mar 2019 •,"My wife and I celebrated our 20 year Anniversary at Ad Hoc Restaurant on March 26.  We could not have chosen a better restaurant!  Our menu choice that evening was the 'Seafood Tasting' that included wine.

We arrived at 7:00pm and left at 11:30pm.  Yes, we were there 4 1/2 hours, and loved every minute of it!  From your gracious hostess the moment we walked in, perfect service, incredible courses, and perfectly matched wines, our dinner far exceeded our hopes and expectations.

There are several options for dinner, such as the tasting menus, with or without paired wines as well as a tasting menu with  or without truffles for those who fancy something slightly different. 

We went for the Ad Hoc tasting of starters - beef tartare, roulade with prosciutto and buffalo cheese, and pumpkin blossom with ricotta and basil and they were all very tasty! 

We opted for a selection of mains (where you can try two different mains but as a smaller portion) I went for Seabass rolled in zucchini and beef cheek, and my girlfriend went for suckling pig and breaded cod fish. We were very happy with our choices as they were so very tasty and the portion size was just right.

Italy,Ad Hoc Ristorante (Piazza del Popolo),Positive,A Dining Highlight,Jan 2019 •,"This was a wonderful dining experience. Upon arrival, we were shown to a private booth for our family of four and offered a complimentary glass of prosecco.  While the multi-course meal was delicious, what we appreciated most was how the staff bent over backward to accommodate our daughter, who is vegan.

I had the black truffle menu, usually a solid choice. We started off with slow service and an amuse bouch that was a tasteless spinach purée.

Natalia, the waitress was always forthcoming and of great service. Always willing to please. Before leaving, she served me a pleasant dijestive: Spiced polish vodka. All in all a great experience.

I ended up not getting the discount and they added an extra service charge to our bill. I guess as revenge for my complaint. My friends who were sitting at a separate table found glass in their food and did not receive the extra service charge... All in all very weird and the food was mediocre at best.,-0.3459,Negative,3

Russia,Pelmenya,Negative,"Cheap food, cheaper taste.",Jan 2017 •,"Service is awful and slow. If you order lunch, might as well prepare to eat it by dinner. 
What about the food, though? They only have manti, khinkali and others from the same line of ""food thinking"". So are they specialized? Far from it. The taste is as blend as a fruit smoothie, the dough from the khinkali came partially raw and, apparently, they have quite a lot of oil to use in their food. Besides being fried (you expect it to be partially crunchy), the khinkali came soft and mushy. The taste of the filling is overpowering and strong enough to the point you can barely eat more than one fork of it.
The aperitifs, though, seems to be much better, as the ""Mozzarella with tomatoes and basil"" came as good as you could expect for the price range (besides being quite oily as well).
They are not ""internationally ready"" as the drinks menu, sometimes, has no english translation and the staff had a hard time understanding me and communicating, resulting in one dish coming wrongly. They are quite friendly and try their best, though. Had no problem changing the dish without additional charges.
Have I mentioned that even the dessert is oily? This place should watch out as Trump may give them some ""freedom"" for the oil.

For an almost 5 star rating restaurant on Trip Advisor, the fame might have overpowered them and the food quality came low as fast as the ratings went high. Or the peoples food taste is just dubitable.
Would I recommend? Not even if you have no money to eat, there are better (and healthier, considering the amount of oil they use here) fast foods and bakeries for the same price range. Would I come back? Unless I need to fry some potatoes with my blood afterwards, nop.

Russia,Pelmenya,Positive,Delectable Dumplings!,Dec 2015 •,"Whilst I would not recommend this eatery for dinner, it makes a perfect pit stop for a hearty, cheap and filling lunch. No one should visit this part of the world without trying dumplings, meat or vegetables encased in an unleavened dough which are then boiled (and sometimes fried). They are a historic food staple and cherished part of the Russian and Central Asian diet. At Pelmenya you can experiment with a variety of dumplings including the famous Russian pelmeni, but also Ukrainian vareniki, Georgian khinkali, Uzbek manti, and also Chinese dim sum and Italian ravioli. 

We naturally tried pelmeni, resembling tortellini stuffed with ground beef and then boiled; vareniki, crescent shaped crimped parcels containing mashed potato and boiled;  khinkali, large purse shaped spicy dumplings stuffed with pork and beef, boiled and then fried that contain a mouthwatering savoury broth, and manti, containing spicy minced lamb that are boiled. Other fillings, both savoury and sweet, are available. Our choices came with a variety of condiments, including fried onions and sour cream, all except the khinkali which are supposed to be consumed plain and without the use of knives or forks; you should eat them with your hands leaving just the ‘stalk’ or ‘kudi’ of the dumpling where the pleats meet, which is tough. We particularly liked the fact that you could chose how many pieces of each dumpling to try (you’d want rather more pelmeni than khinkali), and the menu was in English as well as Russian. 

The waiting staff were very helpful and pleasant and spoke good English, the restaurant has a hip, modern vibe with free WiFi, although I would not want to sit for long on the high wooden chairs, opting instead for a more comfortable circular table. There are a variety of beverages on offer, but surprisingly, only one Russian beer – Baltica - which is a something of a shame as beer goes so well with dumplings and it would be nice to see this business supporting the growing Russian craft beer and ale scene.",whilst would recommend eatery dinner make perfect pit stop hearty cheap filling lunch one visit part world without trying dumpling meat vegetable encased unleavened dough boiled sometimes fried historic food staple cherished part russian central asian diet pelmenya experiment variety dumpling including famous russian pelmeni also ukrainian vareniki georgian khinkali uzbek manti also chinese dim sum italian ravioli naturally tried pelmeni resembling tortellini stuffed ground beef boiled vareniki crescent shaped crimped parcel containing mashed potato boiled khinkali large purse shaped spicy dumpling stuffed pork beef boiled fried contain mouthwatering savoury broth manti containing spicy minced lamb boiled filling savoury sweet available choice came variety condiment including fried onion sour cream except khinkali supposed consumed plain without use knife fork eat hand leaving stalk kudi dumpling pleat meet tough particularly liked fact could chose many piece dumpling try want rather pelmeni khinkali menu english well russian waiting staff helpful pleasant spoke good english restaurant hip modern vibe free wifi although would want sit long high wooden chair opting instead comfortable circular table variety beverage offer surprisingly one russian beer baltica something shame beer go well dumpling would nice see business supporting growing russian craft beer ale scene,0.0,1,0,"Delectable Dumplings!
